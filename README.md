# COVID19-SIMULATION-USING-BROWNIAN-DYNAMICS
We obtained a simple contagion model, when making certain analogies between a human population and a two-dimensional coloidal suspension system under brownian motion. We consider Hermosillo's population density (a city located in Sonora, Mexico). In this model we include sanitary measurements such as  Stay Home and Keep your Distance.
